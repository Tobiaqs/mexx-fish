# mexx-fish
Run the program using http://fishlanguage.com/ (or fish.py).

The program throws two dice. If the dice multiplied together are 2, then MEXX is printed. If the dice have an equal value, that value is shown suffixed with two zeroes. Otherwise, the two values are printed in order from large to small.
